Have you ever thought how easy it will be to write Desktop User interface in HTML. You will never ever have to use Labels and ClickListener and any those kind of stuff.This is useful only if you are more of a web developer and now want to design a desktop application.

This project will also be useful if you want to persist your web UI to a desktop extension of your WebApp.

So did you like the smell of it, then why don't you taste it?

Currently I only have a working demo and its not complete(or even near), It will be very helpful if you can join and help me make it possible.

Check [README](https://code.google.com/p/webtodesktop/wiki/README) for detailed instructions on how to use this project.
